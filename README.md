# Electrophysiology Workshop

Materials for a practical workshop on extracellular electrophysiology: probes, implants, grounding/reference, head-fixed vs freely-moving setups, synchronization + tracking, optogenetics, flexible probes, and preprocessing/spike sorting.

**Instructor:** Misi Voroslakos (Buzsáki Lab, NYU)  
**Date:** 2025-12-11

## Start here
- **Front page / website:** See `docs/index.md` (GitHub Pages)
- **Slides (PDF):** `slides/Electrophysiology_Workshop.pdf`

## Who this is for
Trainees and researchers who want to understand and execute modern extracellular ephys experiments (silicon probes, Neuropixels, microdrives) and the practical engineering tradeoffs.

## Learning goals
By the end, you should be able to:
1. Choose an appropriate probe + implant approach for a scientific question.
2. Understand the full acquisition chain (probe → headstage → DAQ → sync).
3. Make informed grounding/reference decisions and troubleshoot noise.
4. Plan a recording preparation (head-fixed or freely-moving).
5. Outline a preprocessing + spike sorting pipeline and common pitfalls.
6. Design a basic optotagging experiment and interpret latency statistics.

## Modules
1. Background & recommended reading
2. Short history of extracellular recording
3. Parts of an extracellular ephys system
4. Probe “anatomy” + vendor landscape
5. Microdrive vs Neuropixels (unit yield vs coverage)
6. Ground & reference (practical rules + troubleshooting)
7. Head-fixed vs freely moving: when and why
8. Synchronization, automation, and behavior tracking
9. Optogenetics (optrodes, on-head diodes, microLED probes, optotagging)
10. Flexible probes: promises and reality check
11. Channel maps: headstage ↔ probe geometry
12. Preprocessing & spike sorting
