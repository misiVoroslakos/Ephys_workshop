# Module 01 — Background & pre-work

This module is the “on-ramp”: what to skim before the workshop, plus a short checklist so you can follow the hands-on parts smoothly.

## Pre-work reading
[**Guide to Research Techniques in Neuroscience**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/monograph/9780128005118/guide-to-research-techniques-in-neuroscience)
- **Chapter 3** — *Stereotaxic Surgeries and In Vivo Techniques*
- **Chapter 4** — *Electrophysiology*
- **Chapter 8** — *Manipulating Neural Activity*

**Guide to biopotentials, electric fields**

## What you should be able to answer after this module
- What “extracellular electrophysiology” measures (and what it does *not* measure).
- The difference between **acute** and **chronic** recordings.
- The purpose of **ground vs reference** (high-level intuition only — details later).
- The main “moving parts” of a modern ephys experiment (probe → headstage → DAQ → sync).

## Optional (highly recommended) before attending live
- Watch at least one short video overview of silicon probes / Neuropixels workflows (implant → recording → spike sorting).
- Skim a basic spike sorting primer so terms like “template”, “drift”, and “unit yield” are not brand new.

## Checklist (bring to the workshop)
- Laptop + charger
- Notes app / text editor
- (If you have it) a sample dataset you’re allowed to share OR a public dataset you want to practice on
- Questions you want answered (e.g., “why do I lose units over days?”, “how do I choose probe geometry?”, “grounding nightmares”)
