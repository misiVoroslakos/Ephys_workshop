# Module 07 — Head-fixed vs freely moving: when and why

## Head-fixed: good for
- precise stimulus timing/control
- stable geometry (often cleaner recordings)

## Freely moving: good for
- navigation, naturalistic behavior, sleep/consolidation
- richer motor output

## Quick rule-of-thumb
- if you need **tight stimulus control** → head-fixed
- if you need **natural movement or sleep** → freely moving

## Exercise
For your project:
1. What must the animal do?
2. What’s the minimal behavioral measurement?
3. Biggest risk: behavior quality or recording quality?
